<p>Aksi 212 is only one day away. Netizens both pro and contra side are hyped about the event. They actively tweets (or retweet or copas) about the event. I am curious about seeing the hyped in another side. I want to see the battle of pro and conta side in twitter.</p>
<p>To fullfil my curiosity, I crawled data from twitter a day before aksi 212 (December 1, 2016). In order to simplify the analysis, I only crawled 1500 tweets contains keyword “aksi bela islam” on that period.</p>
<p>By applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis">social network analysis</a> method, the collected tweets then visualize to find its network structure. Tools I used to done this task is R for collecting and preprocessing data, and Gephy for visualizing network.</p>

<h3>What the graph tell us?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The battle is real! there are polarization between netizen who’re pro and contra with aksi 212. it created 2 main clusters wich is disconnected</li>
<li><span class="citation">@maspiyungan</span> dkk in pro side vs <span class="citation">@zevanya</span> in contra side. The pro side is more dominant than contra side. They clustered in one big cluster and connected each other formed (very) big buble, while in contra side only <span class="citation">@zevanya</span> gathered big buble (red circle), others Ahok’s buzzer like <span class="citation">@digembok</span> <span class="citation">@gunromli</span> etc just created small buble (smaller red circle)</li>
<li>It’s about 6 influencers who’re pro with “aksi 212” gathered and formed big bubble. They are <span class="citation">@maspiyungan</span>, <span class="citation">@husainiadianm</span> <span class="citation">@GrabJakmania</span>, <span class="citation">@posmetro</span>, <span class="citation">@hidcom</span> and <span class="citation">@wartapolitik</span>. Their network are close and connect each other. It means netizens who’re pro with aksi 212 interacted with all influencers.</li>
<li>While in contra side (red circle), there is only one influencer which is got high interaction, it’s <span class="citation">@zevanya</span>. There’s also other influencer with small interaction but it’s far and not connected with main influencer. That’s mean the netizens who’re interact with <span class="citation">@zevanya</span> didn’t interact with other influencer, they have different network.</li>
