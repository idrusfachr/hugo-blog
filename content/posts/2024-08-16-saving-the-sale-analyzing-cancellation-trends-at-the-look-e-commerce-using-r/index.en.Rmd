```
### Data Exploration

To begin our analysis, we examined the overall cancellation rate within the dataset. This provided a baseline understanding of the problem's magnitude and its potential impact on the business. By calculating the percentage of cancelled orders and their associated revenue loss, we established a clear picture of the issue at hand.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
order_trend <- dat %>%
  mutate(
    year_month = floor_date(as_date(created_at), "month")) %>%
      group_by(year_month) %>%
      summarize(total_order = n_distinct(order_id),
                cancel_purchase = n_distinct(order_id[status=='Cancelled']),
                cancelation_rate = round(cancel_purchase / total_order * 100,2),
                amount = sum(sale_price * num_of_item),
                amount_cancel = sum(num_of_item[status=='Cancelled']*sale_price[status=='Cancelled'])
  )

summary(order_trend)

```
The analysis reveals an average monthly cancellation rate of *14.97%*, resulting in approximate revenue losses of *$44,802*. To understand the trend of cancellations over time, we examined order data by month.


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(order_trend) +
  geom_col(aes(x = year_month, y = `total_order`, stat="identity", fill="# of Order")) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year_month, y = `cancelation_rate` * 100, color="Cancelation Rate",  group = 1),
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values="black") +
  labs(title = "Purchase and Cancelation Rate Trend", x = "Month", y = "#of Order") +
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / 10000, name = "Cancelation Rate", labels = scales::percent)) +
  annotate(
    'text',
    x = as.Date("2023-03-01"),
    y = 7000,
    label = 'the number of order trend looks \nupward overtime',
    fontface = 'italic',
    size = 2.5
  ) +
  annotate(
    'curve',
    x = as.Date("2023-05-01"), 
    y = 6600,
    yend = 5000,
    xend = as.Date("2024-01-01"),
    linewidth = 0.5,
    curvature = 0.5,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, 'cm'))
  ) +
   annotate(
    'text',
    x = as.Date("2020-01-01"),
    y = 3300,
    label = 'the trend of cancellation rates \ntends to be constant overtime',
    fontface = 'italic',
    size = 2.5
  ) +
  annotate(
    'curve',
    x = as.Date("2020-10-01"), 
    y = 3100,
    yend = 2000,
    xend = as.Date("2021-05-01"),
    linewidth = 0.5,
    curvature = -0.5,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.1, 'cm'))
  ) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.key=element_blank(),
          legend.title=element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
          legend.box="horizontal",
          legend.position= c(.5,.95),
          legend.text=element_text(size=9),
          plot.title = element_text(color="black", size=14, face="bold.italic", hjust=0.5),
          axis.title.x = element_text(color="darkgrey", size=9),
          axis.title.y = element_text(color="darkgrey", size=9) 
        )


```
Despite an upward trend in overall order volume, the cancellation rate has remained consistent. This indicates a persistent issue that warrants further investigation. To identify potential causes, we will examine the relations between order status with some variables.

### Data Analysis

To enhance our analysis, we conducted feature engineering to create new variables.

* *is_cancel* : A binary indicator was created, assigning 1 to cancelled orders and 0 to completed orders.
* *age_group* : Customer ages were grouped into specific intervals to identify potential age-related patterns in cancellations.
* *deliver_to* : Given the US-based distribution center, a binary variable was created to distinguish between domestic and international orders, exploring potential shipping-related impacts on cancellations.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
order_dat <- dat %>%
  filter(status!="Processing")%>%
  group_by(order_id) %>%
  summarise(age=mean(age),
            gender=gender[[1]],
            product_department = product_department[[1]],
            traffic_source = traffic_source[[1]],
          total_item = sum(num_of_item),
          total_amount = sum(num_of_item * sale_price),
          is_cancel = ifelse(status == 'Cancelled', 1, 0),
          deliver_to = ifelse(country == "United States", 1, 0) # 0 if deliver to outside US
          ) %>% 
  ungroup %>% distinct(order_id, .keep_all = TRUE)
#change categorical data to factor

col <- c("gender","product_department", "traffic_source", "is_cancel", "deliver_to")

order_dat %>% mutate_at(col, as.factor)

head(order_dat)
```
#### Analyse numerical variables vs order status

To understand how numerical variables influence order cancellations, we examined age, total items purchased, and total purchase amount. Before conducting correlation tests, we assessed the normality of these variables using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. This test was chosen over Shapiro-Wilk due to its suitability for larger datasets.

H0 : Data follow normal distribution

H1 : Data doesn't follow distribution

```{r warning=FALSE}
#normality check

norm_test <- function(variable) {
  ks_test <- ks.test(order_dat[[variable]], y='pnorm') #set y to pnorm since we want test our variables toward normal distribution
  res <- paste0("data :", variable, "  ", "p_value :", ks_test$p.value)
  return(res)
}

#Select only numerical variables
numeric_vars <- c("total_item", "age", "total_amount")

# Calculate the correlation matrix
norm_test_results <- lapply(numeric_vars, norm_test)

names(norm_test_results) <- norm_test_results
norm_test_results 


```
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test revealed that all three numerical variables (age, total items, and total amount) deviate significantly from a normal distribution (p-value < 0.005). As a result, non-parametric tests are required. To assess differences in these variables between successful and cancelled orders, we employed the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

H0 : There *is no difference* (in terms of central tendency) between the two groups in the population.

H1 : There *is difference* (in terms of central tendency) between the two groups in the population.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ltm)

#function for wilcoxon test
wilcox_test <- function(variable) {
  wilcox <- wilcox.test(order_dat[[variable]][which(order_dat$is_cancel == 1)], order_dat[[variable]][which(order_dat$is_cancel == 0)])
  res <- paste0("data :", variable, "  ", "p_value :", wilcox$p.value)
  return(res)
}

# Calculate the correlation
wilcox_test_results <- lapply(numeric_vars, wilcox_test)

wilcox_test_results
```
With p-values greater than 0.05 for all numerical variables, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This indicates no statistically significant difference in the central tendency (median) of these variables between successful and cancelled orders. Visualizations also confirmed these findings, showing overlapping distributions for both groups.


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggpubr)
set.seed(123)

age_bx <- ggplot(order_dat) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=as.factor(is_cancel), y=age)) +
  theme_bw()

item_bx <- ggplot(order_dat) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=as.factor(is_cancel), y=total_item)) +
  theme_bw()

amount_bx <- ggplot(order_dat) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=as.factor(is_cancel), y=total_amount)) +
  theme_bw()

figure <- ggarrange(age_bx, item_bx, amount_bx,
                    common.legend = TRUE, legend="bottom", ncol = 3, nrow = 1)

annotate_figure(figure, top = text_grob("Order Status By Age, Total Item and Total Amount", 
               color = "red", face = "bold", size = 12))

```
Visualizations also confirmed these findings, showing overlapping distributions for both groups. across age, number of items, or total purchase amount. 

* Age of users has no signficant correlation towards order status
* Number of item of purchase has no signficant correlation towards order status
* Total amount of purchase has no signficant correlation towards order status

Consequently, these numerical variables do not appear to significantly influence order cancellation rates.

#### Analyse categorical variables vs order status

Next, we'll examine how categorical variables such as product department, age group, traffic source, and delivery destination relate to order cancellations. To determine if there's a significant association between these variables and order status, we'll conduct chi-square tests.

H0 : There's no association between categorical variables and order status

H1 : There's association between categorical variables and order status

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Categorize age group into categorical variables
order_dat <- order_dat %>% 
  mutate(
    # Create categories
    age_group = dplyr::case_when(
      age <= 17            ~ "0-17",
      age > 17 & age <= 25 ~ "18-25",
      age > 25 & age <= 34 ~ "26-45",
      age > 45 & age <= 55  ~ "46- 54",
      age > 54  ~ ">55"
    )
)
order_dat$age_group = as.factor(order_dat$age_group)

# Function to perform Chi-Square test for a given variable
chi_square_test <- function(variable) {
  table <- table(order_dat[[variable]], order_dat$is_cancel)
  chisq <- chisq.test(table)
  return(chisq)
}

# List of categorical variables
categorical_vars <- c("product_department", "gender", "traffic_source", "deliver_to", "age_group")

# Apply Chi-Square test to each categorical variable
chi_square_results <- lapply(categorical_vars, chi_square_test)

# Display the results
names(chi_square_results) <- categorical_vars
chi_square_results
```
Based on the chi-square test results, here's a the conclusion:

1. Product Department and Gender: Both tests show identical results (p-value = 0.1916). This suggests no significant association between order status and product department or gender. The similarity in results might indicate these variables are closely related or potentially the same in our dataset.

2. Traffic Source: With p-value = 0.3273, there's no significant association between traffic source and order status. The different sources (organic, email, social, etc.) don't appear to influence cancellation rates significantly.

3. Delivery Destination: The test (p-value = 0.6675) indicates no significant relationship between delivery destination (export or domestic) and order status. Whether an order is domestic (US) or international doesn't seem to affect cancellation rates.

4. Age Group: With p-value = 0.5151, there's no significant association between age groups and order status. This suggests that cancellation rates don't vary significantly across different age categories.


In summary, none of the tested variables show a statistically significant association with order status at the conventional 0.05 significance level. This implies that these factors alone may not be strong predictors of order cancellations in our e-commerce dataset. 

### Findings and Recommendations

The lack of significant correlations suggests that factors beyond the analyzed variables contribute to cancellations. Potential areas for further investigation include:

* Product-related issues: Product quality, descriptions, or images might influence cancellations.
* Customer service: Issues during the checkout process or post-purchase support could impact customer satisfaction.
* Website experience: Website performance, navigation, or mobile optimization might affect the purchase journey.
* Pricing and promotions: Price perception or promotional factors could influence purchase decisions.
* By focusing on these areas, The Look E-commerce can potentially reduce cancellation rates and improve customer satisfaction.


### Conclusion

While this analysis identified no direct correlations between the studied variables and order cancellations, it highlights the need for further exploration into other potential factors. Continuous monitoring of cancellation rates and in-depth analysis of specific customer segments are essential for effective retention strategies.
