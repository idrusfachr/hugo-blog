In todayâ€™s data-driven world, the ability to transform complex data into a compelling narrative is a crucial skill. Whether you are a business analyst, marketer, or researcher, effectively communicating data insights can set you apart and drive meaningful impact. This is where the book ["Storytelling with Data"](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/) by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic comes into play.

Here i want to share summary of the go-to book for data visualization. This slide i created with my colleague [Muslikh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muslihannur) back when we were on GDP Labs, we also had a chance to share the slide to our team. Me personally shared this slide again 2 times during my tenure at Aruna, one for the internal data team and the other for broaden audience with various background across company.

Table of contents :
1. the importance of context
2. choosing an effective visual
3. clutter is your enemy
4. focus on your audience attention
5. think like a designer
6. lessons in storytelling
7. implementation: OKR dashboard (skipped)

I really recommend a data practitioner or everyone who has interest in data visualization or stroytelling to read this book.
